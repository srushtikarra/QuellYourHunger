# QuellYourHunger
This web application takes user input about what type of restuarants they are looking for, while specifying specific sorting methods or attributes they wish to add to the search. The app uses YELP search and business APIs, and GOOGLE maps to return the top 20 businesses that best fit the user's search and return them in a table along with a map view, which has markers for each of the businesses. 

Part of the app programs the app so that it takes location from the browser being used, but this seems to only work in Safari due to Google's and Firefox's extensive security when it comes to unsecure web servers. Therefore, it will default to using the location entered by the user manually. 

The web application was created using Eclipse (languages: Java and Javascript), and given a public server by uploading to Amazon Web Services. Public URL: http://lowcost-env.3cxea35xnc.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
